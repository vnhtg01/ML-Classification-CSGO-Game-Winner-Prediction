# ML Multiclass Classification Project for CSGO Game Winner Prediction
#### Objective : Build a machine learning model to perform **Multiclass classification** based on a real dataset from Kaggle. Project done in python on jupyter notebook.
#### Notes : Class `0` represents *Lost*, class `1` represents *Tie (Draw)*, class `2` represents *Win*.

A. Pipeline Overview
=====

1. **Data Import** : from Kaggle
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Visualization**  
   - Check for missing values
   - F-statistics, P-value, Chi square
   - Deleting/Keeping unnecessary series according to p-value and domain knowledge
   - Analyze variable distributions/density
   - Compute correlation matrix
   - Labelencoder for target column
   - Create a report of dataset from ydata_profiling
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Multi-Collinearity Test
   - SimpleImputer
   - Robusting (scaling) for numerical features and OneHotEncoder for categorical feature (before removing it)
   - Train/Test split
   - GridSearchCV to find the bests hyperparameters
5. **Model Training** 
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest
   - (Bonus) LazyPredict to show performances of 30-40 differents models
6. **Model Evaluation** 
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Classification report  
   - Confusion matrix
   - ROC AUC
   - (Bonus) Quickly check other models
7. **Model Deployment** : not included
